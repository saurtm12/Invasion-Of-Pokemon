He realizes that there is some mysterious creatures living in the Tampere city. Unluckily, he only owns a bike. 
Your dog, Brian,is your sidekick. He also able to fight the pokemon too. But he can not use the bus as the bus driver want to keep his bus clean!
That means he would only be able to go somewhere in short distance and slow. Tampere has developed its bus system - fast and omnipresent. 
As the situation that mysterious creatures are affecting the city, the city gives him permission to use the public buses for free if he can catch the Pokemons.
Those Pokemon some want to stay at a point. Some naughty Pokemon would want to amble in the city.
